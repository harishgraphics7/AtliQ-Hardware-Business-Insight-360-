  **Margin inefficiencies** are evident across specific products and regions, particularly in the **Gaming category** and the **APAC region**. Focused marketing and pricing strategies are recommended.

- **Supply Chain View**:  
  **Forecast accuracy** remains reasonable; however, inventory challenges persist in regions like **LATAM** and **India**, affecting supply continuity and service levels.

- **Executive View**:  
  While **market share** is increasing, **profitability is under pressure**. Notable growth potential exists in the **PC segment** and regions such as **North America (NA)** and **India**.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges & üìò Learnings

### üî¥ Challenges

1. **Handling Duplicate Subzones**  
   Encountered issues with duplicate subzone values in the *Market Share* and *Dim Market* tables, leading to inaccurate calculations and inconsistencies in the data model.

2. **DAX Calculations for Market Share**  
   Writing accurate DAX measures for market share was challenging. Initial formulas returned identical values across all subzones due to data model configuration issues.

3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
   Managing large datasets with missing or inconsistent values was time-intensive, especially when dealing with multiple interconnected tables.

---

### ‚úÖ Learnings

1. **Resolving Many-to-Many Relationships**  
   Gained practical experience in managing many-to-many relationships using **reference tables** and DAX functions like `ALLNOBLANKROW` to maintain calculation accuracy.

2. **Mastering DAX for Metrics**  
   Enhanced skills in crafting complex **DAX formulas** and understanding how minor syntax variations can significantly impact analytical results.

3. **Importance of Data Cleaning**  
   Recognized the critical role of systematic **data cleaning** in ensuring model consistency and the reliability of insights.

4. **Power BI Data Modeling**  
   Learned best practices for designing structured, scalable **data models** in Power BI to improve performance and dashboard responsiveness.

5. **Reporting with Excel and Power BI**  
   Developed the ability to create intuitive, **user-friendly reports** using both Excel and Power BI to effectively communicate trends and key business metrics.

## ‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations

- **Optimize Operational Efficiency**:  
  Reduce operational and freight-related expenditures to enhance overall **profit margins**.

- **Strengthen Key Account Management**:  
  Prioritize investment in **high-performing accounts** (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart), while reassessing engagement strategies for underperforming clients.

- **Refine Marketing Strategies**:  
  **Reallocate marketing spend** to high-performing regions and product segments; implement cost controls in regions showing suboptimal returns.

- **Enhance Supply Chain Planning**:  
  Improve **demand forecasting** accuracy and streamline inventory management to minimize stockouts and excess inventory.

- **Portfolio Rationalization**:  
  Phase out **low-performing products** and strategically focus on **high-growth markets** and categories, such as PCs and emerging regions.
